### 1. Offset Calibration

To minimize sensor noise and correct inherent bias, an initial calibration routine is executed at startup. During this
process, the system collects **1,000 samples** of raw accelerometer and gyroscope data. The mean of each axis is
computed and treated as the sensor's offset:

```
acc_offset  = (‚àë‚Çú‚Çå‚ÇÄ‚Åπ‚Åπ‚Åπ acc‚Çú)  / N  
gyro_offset = (‚àë‚Çú‚Çå‚ÇÄ‚Åπ‚Åπ‚Åπ gyro‚Çú) / N  

Once t ‚â• 1000, raw sensor data is calibrated as follows:  
calibrated_acc‚Çú  = acc‚Çú  - acc_offset  
calibrated_gyro‚Çú = gyro‚Çú - gyro_offset
```

#### 2. Gyroscope Data ‚Üí Angle Calculation

The gyroscope provides **angular velocity (¬∞/s)**, which can be integrated to obtain **angular displacement (¬∞)**. The
code accumulates the angular velocity over time to estimate the angles of the device:

```
gyAngle‚Çì += gyro‚Çì * Œît;
gyAngle·µß += gyro·µß * Œît
gyAngleùìè += gyroùìè * Œît
```

However, a limitation of gyroscopes is that they suffer from **drift** over time, causing the calculated angles to
accumulate small errors as time progresses.

#### 3. Accelerometer Data ‚Üí Angle Estimation

The accelerometer can be used to estimate **orientation angles** by referencing the **gravity vector**. The code
calculates **pitch (X-axis)** and **roll (Y-axis)** based on accelerometer data:

```
acAngleY = atan(-acc_x / sqrt(acc_y¬≤ + acc_z¬≤)) * 180/œÄ;
acAngleX = atan(acc_y / sqrt(acc_x¬≤ + acc_z¬≤)) * 180/œÄ;
```

The downside of the accelerometer is that it is **noisy**, especially during quick movements or vibrations, leading to
inaccurate angle estimations when the sensor is in motion.

#### 4. Complementary Filter: Combining Both Sensors‚Äô Strengths

- The **gyroscope** offers **smooth and responsive** data but suffers from **long-term drift**.
- The **accelerometer** provides an **absolute reference** (gravity) but can be **noisy** and slow to react.

The **complementary filter** is used to combine the benefits of both sensors:

- `Œ∏‚Çì(t), Œ∏·µß(t)`: Filtered roll and pitch angles (degrees)
- `Œ∏‚Çì(t - 1), Œ∏·µß(t - 1)`: Previous filtered angles
- `gyro‚Çì, gyro·µß`: Angular velocity from the gyroscope (¬∞/s)
- `Œît`: Time elapsed since the last update (seconds)
- `Œ∏_acc‚Çì, Œ∏_acc·µß`: Angle estimated from the accelerometer (degrees)
- `Œ±`: Filter coefficient (range: 0 < Œ± < 1; typically 0.95‚Äì0.98)

| Œ± Value | Behavior Description                                              |
|--------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    0.98 | High reliance on gyro (smooth output, more drift)                 |
|    0.95 | Balanced fusion (commonly used)                                   |
|    0.90 | More responsive to tilt (faster correction, more accel influence) |

```
Œ∏‚Çì‚Çç‚Çú‚Çé = Œ± √ó (Œ∏‚Çì‚Çç‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚Çé + gyro‚Çì √ó Œît) + (1 - Œ±) √ó Œ∏_acc‚Çì
Œ∏·µß‚Çç‚Çú‚Çé = Œ± √ó [Œ∏·µß‚Çç‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚Çé + gyro·µß √ó Œît] + (1 ‚àí Œ±) √ó Œ∏_acc·µß
```

This filter blends the **gyro data** (for fast response) with the **accelerometer data** (for long-term stability),
helping to correct drift over time while preserving real-time responsiveness.

As a result, `sensor_mpu9250_data.complemented_angle_x` provides **a more accurate and stable angle** estimate.
